# Implementing a Transformer
The aim of this project is to implement the transformer architecture. [Transformer Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

One of the main goals to do this is to understand the workings of multi headed attention.
Other goals are to build a good standalone project following industry standards, and using industry adopted technologies.

There are numerous implementations of the transformer architecture, and this by no means is aimed for education purposes or experiments.
